<h2>Using Design Thinking to Address Community Issues</h2>
In this chapter I summarize how I ran a design process in collaboration with the <a href="{{ '/intropersonalscience' | absolute_url }}">personal science community</a> in order to develop a <a href="{{ '/peerproduction' | absolute_url }}">peer production</a> solution for community issues.

## Motivation and starting point
After more than a decade of existence, the personal science community has observed that <b>"the community does not scale up"</b> and that <b>"everyone tends to start their projects from scratch"</b>. This indicates that despite having an active community of self-researchers who run and share their own projects, individuals encounter difficulties accessing the knowledge hidden within the community. Information is often disseminated through word of mouth. 
The community places a high value on sharing methods, data, and lessons and regards its members as equal peers, aligning with the principles of peer production. Consequently, they were interested in trying such an approach.

## Methodology: Design Thinking
To address this loosely-defined task, I employed the design thinking methodology, which is described as a "human-centered approach to discovering innovative solutions to complex problems" (Taheri et al., 2016). The specific framework I utilized is known as the <b>"double diamond"</b>. As illustrated in Figure 1, this framework leads from a broad problem statement (on the left) through the exploration of two "diamonds" that aid in gaining a deeper understanding of and prioritizing the problems, as well as in prototyping and testing solutions, ultimately leading to specific solutions. Emphasis is placed on frequent and close collaboration with end-users and other stakeholders to develop solutions that truly address their needs.

## Stakeholder analysis
Initially, I sought to identify the <b>primary stakeholders</b> for this task, specifically those individuals who would be affected and interested in collaborating to address the issue. In the context of personal science, this encompasses a loosely defined community of individuals who employ research methods to explore their personal questions and concerns. Many individuals engage in personal science independently, without any formal community ties. However, there are certain communities, such as Quantified Self and Open Humans, where participants exchange ideas and insights online through platforms like forums, Slack, and virtual meetings, with occasional in-person events for sharing experiences. Notably, my research lab maintains a close association with Open Humans, with both my supervisor and another lab member serving as community managers. Additionally, there are connections with community managers from Quantified Self, establishing a solid starting point for our efforts.

As our first step, we created <b>personas</b> (archetypical community member) based on the experiences of my lab colleagues and conducted interviews with community members, as part of prior research. This approach allowed us to gain insights into the motivations and challenges faced by various community member and end-user groups, enabling us to prioritize specific aspects.

Here's an exemplary persona:

| <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/katoss/peer-production-in-citizen-science/main/assets/img/persona-taylor-techie.PNG" width="300" /> | *“What can I do?”* <br> Taylor is a software engineer who is interested in playing with technology at large, including playing around with hardware. Taylor loves collecting data, even if they are not 100% sure what it could be used for. |
| **Motivation**        | Internally motivated, excited about technology, likes to spend time on it in their freetime |
| **Challenges**        | Finding a purpose to apply their skills and interests |
| **Community** | Self-research chats, likes to help people with their technology- and data-related questions |
| **Skills**            | **Meta research:** beginner <br> **Data analysis:** intermediate <br> **Coding:** expert |
