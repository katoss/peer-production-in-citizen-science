<h2>Designing Information Architectures Using the “Card Sorting” Method</h2>
<p class="message">This guide is based on my experiences developing a knowledge management system with the personal science community. For more details, please see Chapter 4 of my <a href="">thesis</a>.</p>

<p style="color:red;"><i>This page is currently a work in progress</i></p>

* Motivation: determining information architecture (navigation structure) that makes sense to users
* What: Open card sorting method, from user experience research. Explain principle.
* Preparation
  * How many participants, and who? Depends on analysis method, time, target group
  * How to choose the cards? representative of content, edge cases that don't fit into the current system
  * Moderated or unmoderated? depends on time. moderated is more informative, but takes more time
  * choice of tools
  * inviting to sessions
  * IRB approval? 
* Data collection
  * Tools e.g. kardsort, commercial tools, paper post its, trello, miro (depends on analysis you want to do, if you need to download the data)).
  * Video recording for moderated sessions (e.g. with google meet for remote sessions)
  * Process: welcome, briefing, think aloud
* Data analysis
  * Qualitative: Analysing the video recordings. Transcribing audio (e.g. helped by tactiq, google, but lots of manual work), depending on use case not necessary. maybe just take notes while rewatching, watch out for interesting patterns.
  * Quantitative: commercial tools, free tools casolysis, syncaps, cardsort package
* Testing the information architecture
  * tree testing, closed card sorting
