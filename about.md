<h2 id="my-phd-project-in-less-than-150-words">My PhD project, in less than 150 words</h2>
<p>First, I tried to understand what peer production means, and how it is used in citizen science projects to date. To this end, I summarized <a href="#">key characteristics of peer production to a working model</a>, and applied it to three citizen science <a href="#">case studies</a> (iNaturalist, Public Lab, Zooniverse).</p>
<p>Then, to apply this knowledge to a specific use case, I used a <a href="#">design-thinking process</a> to co-design a peer production approach for and with the <a href="#">personal science</a> community.</p>
<p>This process led to the creation of the <a href="https://wiki.openhumans.org">Personal Science Wiki</a>. The lessons learned regarding the <a href="#">design of community knowledge management platforms</a>, synergies and challenges of <a href="#">implementing participatory design and peer production</a>, as well as <a href="#">motivations and trade-offs of using peer production</a> over crowdsourcing approaches in citizen science contexts are summarized on this website.</p>
<p>Here is an <strong>illustration of the process</strong> that I made at the very beginning of my PhD:</p>
