During my thesis, I <a href="{{ '/designthinking' | absolute_url }}">collaborated with the personal science community</a> to design a <a href="{{ '/peerproduction' | absolute_url }}">peer production approach</a> in citizen science for a real use case. Here you find an introduction to personal science.

## Introduction to Personal Science
Personal science has been defined as the practice of using <b>empirical methods (i.e. collecting data) to answer one's own personal questions</b> (Wolf & de Groot, 2020). Often, these "self-research" questions are related to <b>health or well-being</b>.  Individuals engage in self-research for various reasons, including their interest in experimenting with technology and data or addressing pressing health concerns (Senabre Hidalgo et al., 2021).

This community emerged from the <a href="https://quantifiedself.com/about/what-is-quantified-self/">Quantified Self</a> movement and the increased accessibility of sensor technology and smartphone or wearable apps, making it easier to collect data on various aspects such as heart rate, mood, or physical activity.

Personal Science is considered a form of <b>citizen science in a broader sense</b> (Heyen, 2016; Haklay et al., 2021). Self-researchers employ empirical methods to explore their questions, primarily aiming to gain practical self-knowledge rather than generalizable knowledge. It resembles single-subject research, a common practice in medical research, but with the unique aspect that they serve as both the principal investigator and the subject of their research. Some self-researchers publish scientific articles about their self-research projects, or set the seed for patient-led research projects (see for example the work by <a href="https://www.riggare.se/">Sara Riggare</a> and <a href="https://openaps.org/">OpenAPS</a>).

## Examples
Here are some talks self-researchers gave about their projects in the context of Quantified Self's "Show and Tell" talk events:

* <a href="https://wiki.openhumans.org/wiki/Tracking_My_Hearing_Loss">Tracking My Hearing Loss</a>
* <a href="https://wiki.openhumans.org/wiki/Which_Grasses_Aggravate_My_Allergies%3F">Which Grasses Aggravate My Allergies?</a>
* <a href="https://wiki.openhumans.org/wiki/My_Headaches_From_Tracking_Headaches">My Headaches From Tracking My Headaches</a>

## How can I get in touch with the community?
If you want to discuss your own self-research projects with like-minded people, or just want to chat or see what community members have been working on, there are several ways to get in touch:

* <a href="https://www.openhumans.org/self-research/">Weekly self-research chats</a> (every Thursday, 7pm CET/CEST - anyone can join, no registration required :)
* <a href="https://forum.quantifiedself.com/">Quantified Self Forum</a>
* <a href="http://slackin.openhumans.org/">Open Humans Slack channel</a>
* <a href="https://wiki.openhumans.org/wiki/Personal_Science_Wiki">Personal Science Wiki</a>
