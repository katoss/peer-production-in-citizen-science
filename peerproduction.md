<h2>Peer Production in Citizen Science: What? Why? How?</h2>

<p>Peer production, short for "commons-based peer production" (CBPP), designates a mode of production where online communities self-organize their work (Benkler, 2002). The resources produced are community-created, mostly by volunteers who decide by themselves what they want to work on, and who are not paid for it. While this does not sound like a sustainable production model, successful projects prove the opposite: The most well-known examples are Wikipedia, and open source software like the operating system Linux.</p>

<p>In my thesis I aimed to <a href="{{ '/introvolunteerengagement' | absolute_url }}">explore if and how peer production can also be used in citizen science</a>, to support volunteer engagement in more phases of the research cycle. To do so, I first created a theory-based working model of peer production, and used this to analyze 3 citizen science case studies. The results of this are summarized on this page.</p>

<h2>Working model of peer production</h2>

<p>This model summarizes 7 characteristics of peer production platforms for citizen science contexts. It contains online platform features that enable the work of self-organizing communities.</p>

<p><b>Note:</b> Apart from platform features that support self-organized production, there are other factors important in commons-based peer production. For a work that goes deeper into aspects of governance, licensing, and impact, see Fuster Morell et al. (2021).</p>

<p>The characteristics are further explained in the guidelines and illustrated in the case studies below.</p>

<h2>Case Studies</h2>
<p>Here are some case studies with the model to see how peer production elements are used in active online citizen science projects today:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="{{ '/inaturalist' | absolute_url }}">iNaturalist case study</a></li>
  <li><a href="{{ '/publiclab' | absolute_url }}">Public Lab case study</a></li>
  <li><a href="{{ '/zooniverse' | absolute_url }}">Zooniverse case study</a></li>
</ul>

 <h2>Guidelines</h2>
 <p>Here are guidelines that can help you walk through each peer production characteristic. They might be used both for analyzing existing citizen science projects, or for designing new ones. For each characteristic, there is a guiding question, a heuristic (or "rule of thumb"), and a short overview of motivations and trade offs to consider.</p>

<p><b>Note: </b>These guidelines are based on the 3 case studies referenced above. They might not generalize to other contexts. If you used the guidelines for your own projects, <a href="{{ '/#contact' | absolute_url }}">I would love to know about your experiences.</a></p>
