# Peer Production in Citizen Science
_Sharing lessons on using peer production in citizen science from my PhD thesis_

## Welcome
This website shares lessons from my PhD project, in which I explored an online collaboration approach called **“peer production” as a means to support deeper volunteer engagement in citizen science** projects.
By summarizing methods and lessons from my thesis and sharing them on this website, I hope to provide a useful resource **for citizen science researchers and practitioners** facing similar challenges striving for meaningful volunteer engagement in their online projects ([_**jump directly to the resources**_](#resources-for-citizen-science-practitioners)). 

## My PhD project, in less than 150 words
First, I tried to understand what peer production means, and if and how it is used in citizen science projects to date. To this end, I summarized [key characteristics of peer production to a working model](#), and applied it to three citizen science [case studies](#) (iNaturalist, Public Lab, Zooniverse).

Then, to apply this knowledge to a specific use case, I used a [design-thinking process](#) to co-design a peer production approach for and with the [personal science](#) community.

This process led to the creation of the [Personal Science Wiki](https://wiki.openhumans.org). The lessons learned regarding the [design of community knowledge management platforms](#), synergies and challenges of [implementing participatory design and peer production](#), as well as [motivations and trade-offs of using peer production](#) over crowdsourcing approaches in citizen science contexts are summarized on this website.

Here is an illustration of the process that I made at the very beginning of my PhD: TODO add
