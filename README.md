# Lanyon

Lanyon is an unassuming [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) theme that places content first by tucking away navigation in a hidden drawer. It's based on [Poole](http://getpoole.com), the Jekyll butler.

## Usage

Lanyon is a theme built on top of [Poole](https://github.com/poole/poole), which provides a fully furnished Jekyll setup—just download and start the Jekyll server. See [the Poole usage guidelines](https://github.com/poole/poole#usage) for how to install and use Jekyll.


## Options

Lanyon includes some customizable options, typically applied via classes on the `<body>` element.


### Sidebar menu

Create a list of nav links in the sidebar by assigning each Jekyll page the correct layout in the page's [front-matter](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/frontmatter/).

```
---
layout: page
title: About
---
```

**Why require a specific layout?** Jekyll will return *all* pages, including the `atom.xml`, and with an alphabetical sort order. To ensure the first link is *Home*, we exclude the `index.html` page from this list by specifying the `page` layout.


### Themes

Lanyon ships with eight optional themes based on the [base16 color scheme](https://github.com/chriskempson/base16). Apply a theme to change the color scheme (mostly applies to sidebar and links).

There are eight themes available at this time.

To use a theme, add any one of the available theme classes to the `<body>` element in the `default.html` layout, like so:

```html
<body class="theme-base-08">
  ...
</body>
```

To create your own theme, look to the Themes section of [included CSS file](https://github.com/poole/lanyon/blob/master/public/css/lanyon.css). Copy any existing theme (they're only a few lines of CSS), rename it, and change the provided colors.


### Reverse layout

Reverse the page orientation with a single class.

```html
<body class="layout-reverse">
  ...
</body>
```


### Sidebar overlay instead of push

Make the sidebar overlap the viewport content with a single class:

```html
<body class="sidebar-overlay">
  ...
</body>
```

This will keep the content stationary and slide in the sidebar over the side content. It also adds a `box-shadow` based outline to the toggle for contrast against backgrounds, as well as a `box-shadow` on the sidebar for depth.

It's also available for a reversed layout when you add both classes:

```html
<body class="layout-reverse sidebar-overlay">
  ...
</body>
```

### Sidebar open on page load

Show an open sidebar on page load by modifying the `<input>` tag within the `sidebar.html` layout to add the `checked` boolean attribute:

```html
<input type="checkbox" class="sidebar-checkbox" id="sidebar-checkbox" checked>
```

Using Liquid you can also conditionally show the sidebar open on a per-page basis. For example, here's how you could have it open on the homepage only:

```html
<input type="checkbox" class="sidebar-checkbox" id="sidebar-checkbox" {% if page.title =="Home" %}checked{% endif %}>
```

## Development

Lanyon has two branches, but only one is used for active development.

- `master` for development.  **All pull requests should be to submitted against `master`.**
- `gh-pages` for our hosted site, which includes our analytics tracking code. **Please avoid using this branch.**

# Peer Production in Citizen Science
_Sharing lessons on using peer production in citizen science from my PhD thesis_

## Welcome
This website is dedicated to my PhD project, in which I explored an online collaboration approach called “peer production” as a means to support deeper volunteer engagement in citizen science projects.
By summarizing methods and lessons from my thesis and sharing them on this website, I hope to provide a useful resource for citizen science researchers and practitioners facing similar challenges striving for meaningful volunteer engagement in their online projects (_**jump right to the resources**_). 

## My PhD project, in less than 150 words
First, I tried to understand what peer production means, and if and how it is used in citizen science projects to date. To this end, I summarized key characteristics of peer production to a working model, and applied it to three citizen science case studies (iNaturalist, Public Lab, Zooniverse).
Then, to apply this knowledge to a specific use case, I used a participatory design-thinking process to co-design a peer production approach for and with the personal science community. Personal science unites people interested in using scientific methods for replying to their own personal questions, often related to health and well-being.
This resulted in the Personal Science Wiki, as well as lessons regarding the design of community knowledge management platforms, synergies and challenges in implementing participatory design and peer production, as well as motivations and trade-offs of using peer production over crowdsourcing approaches in citizen science contexts.

Here is an illustration of the process that I made at the very beginning of my PhD: TODO add
